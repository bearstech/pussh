.SH NAME
pussh \- parallel ssh, run a shell snippet or a whole program quickly on many hosts

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pussh
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fICOMMAND \fR[\fIARGS\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
pussh takes a host list and a shell snippet or a whole program, then run it in
batch mode on all hosts and return their output. It adds facilities to pipe
file or commands to every command's input and/or output. It is meant to be a
natural extension to the SSH batch mode (eg.: in | sh "command args ..." |
out), although having many inputs and outputs does not let you use pipes the
same way; you will have to decide how to multiplex those inputs and outputs,
which should hopefully be easy.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--from-file\fR FILE
connect to hosts listed in FILE, one per line.  Special file '-' may be used
for stdin. Empty lines or lines starting with a dash (#) are ignored.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--hosts\fR HOST,...
connect to hosts. Several -h options may be used.
.TP
\fB-i\fR, \fB--input\fR INPUT
feed a file (%h to split by host, -i in/%h.txt) or a command to remote stdin
(-i 'tar -czC in/%h|')
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--login\fR USER
remote login name; shortcut for -s '-l USER'
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--dry-run\fR
dry run: don't run commands, only print what would be done
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--output\fR OUTPUT
output to a file (%h to split by host, -o out/%h.txt), or to a command
(-o '|tar -xzC out/%h')
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
quiet: don't stamp (prefix) stdout and stderr, do not report total hosts and
time
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--rate\fR RATE
connect rate in new SSH connections/sec (default: 10)
.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB--ssh-opt\fR OPTIONS
pass OPTIONS to SSH, eg. -s '-x -p 2022'
.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fB--upload\fR
upload the command file and run its copy remotely
.TP
\fB--help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB--version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
You may use the SSH syntax \fBlogin@host\fR for HOST within \fB--from-file\fR and \fB--hosts\fR options to specify a different login for each host. This will override the \fB--login\fR option if given.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Show all servers rootfs usage in descending order :
.IP
pussh -f servers df -h / |grep /dev |sort -rn -k5
.PP
Count the number of processors in a cluster :
.IP
pussh -f servers grep ^processor /proc/cpuinfo |wc -l
.PP
Show the processor models, sorted by occurence :
.IP
pussh -f servers sed -ne "s/^model name.*: //p" /proc/cpuinfo |sort |uniq -c
.PP
Fetch a list of installed package in one file per host :
.IP
pussh -f servers -o packages-for-%h dpkg --get-selections
.PP
Mass copy a file tree (broadcast) :
.IP
tar czf files.tar.gz ... && pussh -f servers -i files.tar.gz tar -xzC /to/dest
.PP
Mass copy several remote file trees (gather) :
.IP
pussh -f servers -o '|(mkdir -p %h && tar -xzC %h)' tar -czC /src/path .
