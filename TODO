TODO:

- output grouping (per host buffering until command is done) + optional sorting
  (different than pussh ...|sort since it keeps per host time ordered output)

- limit number of simultaneous connections

- don't fold host's stderr into stdout, eg:
  ( ( cmd | sed 's/^/out: /' )  3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 ) | sed 's/^/err: /' 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3

- gather command exit status, make some use (stats, etc)
